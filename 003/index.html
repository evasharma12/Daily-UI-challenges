                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The definition of Vampire: a dead person who leaves the grave at
                        night to bite and suck blood from living people.

                        The very definition would cause you to assume that this book is about the un-dead who only come
                        out at night and prey on humans, especially young females who are out wandering in places that
                        they shouldn't.

                        Not Vampire Academy!!!!
                        Even if you don't like Vampire based stories, I suggest you give Vampire Academy a chance. It is
                        full of action, fighting, romance, drama, mystery and much more.

                        This book was a page turner. There was not a second that went by that I was distracted because I
                        was so involved with this book.</p>
